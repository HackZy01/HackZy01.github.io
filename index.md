## Hello,

### About me
I don't really cosider myself as a developer, just someone who wants to make other people's lives easier

### What do I want to achieve
Simplyfing tasks for people that aren't experienced

## My version of FinalHE
It is meant to be as multi-platform as possible, as the original dev ditched precompiled versions for platforms other than Windows

## Updates to older projects:
Elementary OS Compile Script has a well deserved update, that includes a version picker and auto saying yes to dependency installation
